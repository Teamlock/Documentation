This is the secret form. 

In Teamlock each information can be encrypted if you want to.
You just have to click on the lock on the right of each input.

Be aware that encrypted informations can't be searched on the database.
So encrypt only sensible informations.

On the password input, you have a button on the left, who allow you to generate the password.
If the workspace have a password policy, the password will be generated accordingly to it. 
If the folder of the secret have a password policy, this policy will be used instead of that of the workspace.
