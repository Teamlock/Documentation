This is the secret creation form. 

In Teamlock each field can be encrypted if you want to.
You just have to click on the lock icon on the right side of each field.

Be aware that encrypted fields can't be searched on the database.
So encrypt only sensible fields.

On the password field, you have a button on the left, which allows you to generate the password.
If the workspace has a password policy, the password will be generated accordingly to it. 
If the folder of the secret has a password policy, this policy will be used instead of that of the workspace.
