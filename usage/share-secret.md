You can share secret with external people by mail or SMS.

If you want to send secret over SMS, you will have to create an account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and buy a phone number.

On a key line, you can right click on the secret column to show the context menu.


If you send the secret over mail, you can define the expiration date of the sharing.

If you share over SMS, make sure to define the International Country Code (ex: +33 for France)
