A workspace is a safe box where you will store your secrets.
We recommand you to create a workspace for each team and/or project within your company.

This way you will only be able to share the secrets with the right people.

Here is the front page of Teamlock.
On the left you can see the list of your Workspace.
Shared workspaces will appear here also.

## Password Policy

You can define a password policy for the Workspace.
All saved secrets must respect this policy.
